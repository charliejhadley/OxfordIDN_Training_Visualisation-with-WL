# Visualusation: Wolfram Language and Mathematica for researchers

This course introduces the Wolfram Language and the Mathematica environment from the point of view of an user interested (or experienced) in visualising research data and creating interactive content.

n this course we do not consider the nature of the Wolfram Language from the point of view of a computer programmer and in fact deliberately gloss over functionality required to build generic solutions to programming tasks. It's advised that you investigate the Wolfram Lnguage and Mathematica Fundamentals course to solidify the knowledge you develop here.

This course also does not cover the diverse analytical capabilities of the Wolfram Language, for instance its network analysis, machine learning, or analytical calculus functions. Future ITLP course may concentrate on these features if there is sufficient interest.

# What you need to start

- An installation of Mathematica (v10+), a free trial may be downloaded from [wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/](wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/) or see [physics.ox.ac.uk/it/mathematica/](http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/it/mathematica/) to see if you have access to the Oxford University license

# Working with these materials

During the course you will need the materials in this repository ([https://github.com/ox-it/OxfordIDN_Training_Visualisation-with-WL](https://github.com/ox-it/OxfordIDN_Training_Visualisation-with-WL). Here's a short URL [https://goo.gl/8BIJsH](https://goo.gl/8BIJsH).
